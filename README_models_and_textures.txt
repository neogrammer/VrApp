3D Drum Kit Assets – Meta Spatial Editor

The drum kit 3D model and its base texture in this folder were created by the
developer using Meta’s Spatial Editor under a Meta developer account and then
exported for use in this application.

These assets are considered original content created with Meta’s tools and are
used in accordance with Meta’s developer terms to the best of the developer’s
knowledge.

The placard with the text on it, I made myself using Gimp3 software.
